In order to have access to shared storage (/sdcard or /storage/emulated/0), Termux needs a storage access permission. It is not granted by default and is not requested on application startup since it is not necessary for normal application functioning.

**Storage access permission will not enable write access to the external sdcard and drives connected over USB.**
